- Go Back --- Returns to one text back with this selection. 
- Return To Start --- Returns to the starting position of this narrative file with this selection. 

## NodeLinks
- Node Links is a serialized class that holds node connection and branching data.

## NodeData
- Nodes Datas is holding Narrative, Script, Event, Start, End node's position data for graph.

## ScriptNode 
- Developing In Process
#### Includes logic:
- If; 
- Else; 
- = ; 
- != ; 
- bool = (false, true)

#### !Currently does not work, is saved, but does not have the logic and saving of operators and Boolean parameters, is under development!

##### The working concept described is demonstrated in the image below:
